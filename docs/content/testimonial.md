### From *Luna Lucadou*

> This extension is perfect! Chrome never seems to suggest cpp docs from my history (probably because of std:: being mistaken for a protocol, and "thread", "string", etc. being too generic), so this saves those extra clicks to get to them.

### From *u/anon_502*

> Awesome! Perhaps I can finally remove Zeal from my laptop.

### From *u/witcher_rat*

> I wanted to thank you - I've been using it on Firefox ever since 
> you posted about the first release. I use it almost every day, so thank you!

### From *u/Adequat91*

> Thanks for your time!... it will save time for many of us :)

### From *Darius-Florentin NeaÈ›u*

> Awesome! You can directly open a page for a feature/entity from docs.
